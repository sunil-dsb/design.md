# Design System: Stripe

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Stripe's website is the gold standard of fintech design -- a system that manages to feel simultaneously technical and luxurious, precise and warm. The page opens on a white canvas (`#ffffff`) with deep navy headings (`#061b31`) and a signature purple (`#533afd`) that functions as both brand anchor and interactive accent. This is not the cold, clinical purple of enterprise software; it is a rich, saturated violet that reads as confident and financially authoritative. The overall impression is of a financial institution redesigned by a world-class type foundry.

The custom `sohne-var` variable font is the defining element of Stripe's visual identity. Every text element enables the OpenType `"ss01"` stylistic set, which modifies character shapes for a distinctly geometric feel. At display sizes (44px-56px), `sohne-var` runs at weight 300 -- an extraordinarily light weight for headlines that creates an ethereal, almost whispered authority. This is the opposite of the bold hero headline convention; Stripe's headlines do not need to shout. The negative letter-spacing (-1.4px at 56px, -0.96px at 48px) tightens the text into dense, engineered blocks.

What truly distinguishes Stripe is its shadow system. Rather than flat or single-layer shadows, Stripe uses blue-tinted shadows: the signature `rgba(50,50,93,0.12)` creates depth with a cool, atmospheric quality -- like elements floating in a twilight sky. The blue-gray undertone of `rgb(50,50,93)` ties directly to the navy-purple brand palette, making even elevation feel on-brand.

**Key Characteristics:**
- `sohne-var` with OpenType `"ss01"` on all text -- a custom stylistic set that defines the brand's letterforms
- Weight 300 as the signature headline weight -- light, confident, anti-convention
- Negative letter-spacing at display sizes (-1.4px at 56px, -0.96px at 48px, -0.64px at 32px) -- progressive relaxation downward
- Blue-tinted shadows using `rgba(50,50,93,0.12)` -- elevation that feels brand-colored
- Deep navy (`#061b31`) headings instead of black -- warm, financial-grade text hierarchy
- Conservative border-radius (4px-8px, workhorse at 4px with 55 occurrences) -- nothing pill-shaped, nothing harsh
- Slate body text (`#64748d`) with blue-gray undertone -- not neutral gray, but brand-tinted secondary text
- `"tnum"` tabular numerals for financial data display at 14px and 11px -- separate OpenType mode for numbers
- `SourceCodePro` at weight 500 as the monospace companion for code and technical labels
- Purple gradient system using `#533afd` through `#7f7dfc` to `#f44bcc` -- violet-to-magenta decorative range

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **Stripe Purple** (`#533afd`): Primary brand color, CTA backgrounds, link text, interactive highlights. A saturated blue-violet at frequency 2782 that anchors the entire system. Used as text color (808), background (7), border (1960), and gradient (5).
- **Deep Navy** (`#061b31`): Primary heading color at frequency 899. Not black, not gray -- a very dark blue that adds warmth and depth to text. The decision to avoid pure black is what gives Stripe text its distinctive premium feel.
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): Page background, card surfaces, button text on dark backgrounds. Frequency 504 across text (133), backgrounds (37), and borders (317).

### Neutral Scale
- **Slate Blue** (`#50617a`): Secondary body text at frequency 1029. A cool blue-gray that sits between heading navy and body slate in the luminance hierarchy.
- **Body Slate** (`#64748d`): Tertiary text, descriptions, captions at frequency 494. The blue undertone prevents the flat, lifeless quality of pure gray body text.
- **Dark Slate** (`#273951`): Form labels, secondary headings at frequency 113. Sits between heading navy and body text in the hierarchy.
- **Mid Slate** (`#3c4f69`): Supplementary text and icon color at frequency 127. Another step in Stripe's unusually granular text-color ladder.
- **Light Slate** (`#7d8ba4`): Muted metadata and tertiary labels at frequency 49.

### Interactive
- **Primary Purple** (`#533afd`): Primary link and CTA color. Active states, selected elements.
- **Periwinkle** (`#7389ff`): Secondary interactive accent at frequency 85. A lighter blue-violet for gradient transitions and secondary highlights.
- **Lavender Border** (`#b9b9f9`): Active/selected state borders on buttons and inputs at frequency 40. Used exclusively as border color.
- **Soft Purple Border** (`#d6d9fc`): Subtle purple-tinted borders for secondary elements at frequency 37.
- **Mid Purple** (`#7f7dfc`): Gradient transition color at frequency 27. Used in text (6), border (15), and gradient (6).

### Surface & Borders
- **Border Default** (`#e5edf5`): Standard border and divider color at frequency 111. Used as background (20), border (81), and gradient (10).
- **Soft Border** (`#d4dee9`): Secondary border color at frequency 2. Slightly warmer than the default border.
- **Lilac Surface** (`#e2e4ff`): Purple-tinted surface for card backgrounds and decorative fills at frequency 16.

### Accent Colors
- **Orange** (`#ff6118`): Warm accent at frequency 100 for icons and decorative elements.
- **Magenta** (`#f44bcc`): Vivid pink-purple at frequency 6, used exclusively in gradients. The far end of the purple-to-pink gradient range.
- **Violet Gradient** (`#da4bfe`): Rich purple at 0.8 opacity, frequency 3, gradient-only. Connects the primary purple to the magenta endpoint.
- **Green** (`#81b81a`): Status and success accent at frequency 15.

### Shadow Colors
- **Shadow Blue** (`rgba(50,50,93,0.12)`): The signature blue-tinted shadow at frequency 2. Deep blue-gray that echoes the brand's navy palette.
- **Shadow Ambient** (`rgba(23,23,23,0.08)`): Soft ambient shadow for subtle elevation at frequency 1.
- **Shadow Soft** (`rgba(23,23,23,0.06)`): Minimal ambient shadow for light lift at frequency 1.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary**: `sohne-var`, variable font with weight range 1-1000
- **Monospace**: `SourceCodePro`, weight 500
- **OpenType Features**: `"ss01"` enabled globally on all `sohne-var` text; `"tnum"` for tabular numbers on financial data and pricing.

| Pico | sohne-var | 8px (0.50rem) | 300-400 | 1.07-1.12 | normal | ss01 | Form labels, separator text |

### Principles
- **Light weight as signature**: Weight 300 at display sizes is Stripe's most distinctive typographic choice. Where others use 600-700 to command attention, Stripe uses lightness as luxury -- the text is so confident it does not need weight to be authoritative.
- **ss01 everywhere**: The `"ss01"` stylistic set is non-negotiable. It modifies specific glyphs to create a more geometric, contemporary feel across all `sohne-var` text. Every element from 56px heroes to 8px form labels carries this feature.
- **Two OpenType modes**: `"ss01"` for display and body text, `"tnum"` for tabular numerals in financial data. These never overlap -- a number in a paragraph uses `ss01`, a number in a pricing table uses `tnum`.
- **Progressive tracking**: Letter-spacing tightens proportionally with size: -1.4px at 56px, -0.96px at 48px, -0.88px at 44px, -0.64px at 32px, -0.26px at 26px, normal at 16px and below. The tracking at tabular sizes reverses: -0.42px at 14px and -0.33px at 11px for numeric density.
- **Three-weight discipline**: Primarily 300 (body and headings), 400 (UI and navigation base), 600 (CTAs and nav buttons). No weight 500 or 700 in the primary font.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4px
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 72, 80, 96
- Most frequent values: 16px (181 occurrences), 8px (80), 24px (59), 4px (47)
- The scale is dense at the small end (every 4px from 4-40), reflecting Stripe's precision-oriented UI for financial data

### Grid & Container
- Max content width: 1266px
- Common column counts: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12
- Hero: centered single-column with generous padding, lightweight headlines at 44px-56px
- Feature sections: 2-4 column grids for feature cards
- Full-width sections at section breaks

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Precision spacing**: Unlike the vast emptiness of minimalist systems, Stripe uses measured, purposeful whitespace. Section spacing clusters at 48px, 60px, 64px, 71px, 80px, and 96px -- six distinct vertical rhythms rather than one uniform gap.
- **Dense data, generous chrome**: Financial data displays use tight 4px-8px internal spacing, but the UI chrome around them uses 16px-24px padding. This creates a sense of controlled density -- like a well-organized spreadsheet in a purposefully framed container.
- **Vertical cadence**: The 71px spacing value (24 occurrences) is unusual and likely tied to a specific section rhythm in the hero or stats area, creating a distinctive vertical beat that departs from standard 8px-grid multiples.

### Border Radius Scale
- Micro (2px-3px): Fine-grained elements, subtle rounding
- Standard (4px): Buttons, inputs, badges -- the workhorse at 55 occurrences
- Comfortable (5px): Standard card containers at 6 occurrences
- Relaxed (6px): Navigation, larger interactive elements at 31 occurrences
- Large (8px): Featured cards, hero elements at 4 occurrences
- Compound: `6px 6px 0px 0px` (top-rounded), `0px 0px 6px 6px` (bottom-rounded), `6px 0px 0px 6px` (left-rounded)

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow | Page background, inline text |
| Subtle (Level 1) | `rgba(23,23,23,0.06) 0px 3px 6px 0px` | Light card lift, hover hints |
| Ambient (Level 2) | `rgba(23,23,23,0.08) 0px 15px 35px 0px` | Standard cards, content panels |
| Elevated (Level 3) | `rgba(50,50,93,0.12) 0px 16px 32px 0px` | Featured cards, dropdowns, popovers |
| Focus Ring | `2px solid #533afd` outline | Keyboard focus states |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Stripe's shadow system is built on a principle of chromatic depth. Where most design systems use neutral gray or black shadows, Stripe's primary shadow color (`rgba(50,50,93,0.12)`) is a deep blue-gray that echoes the brand's navy palette. This creates shadows that do not just add depth -- they add brand atmosphere. The dual-system approach separates neutral ambient shadows (`rgba(23,23,23,...)`) for subtle lift from blue-tinted shadows (`rgba(50,50,93,...)`) for prominent elevation, creating a brand-colored depth hierarchy that distinguishes Stripe from every flat-shadow design system.

## 6.5. Motion & Transitions

### Duration Scale

| Token | Value | Frequency | Use |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----|
| micro | 1ms | 1 | Instant state changes |
| small | 150ms | 14 | Hover feedback, micro-interactions |
| medium | 300ms | 35 | Standard transitions, button state changes |
| large | 600ms | 19 | Section reveals, card expansions |
| xl | 2000ms | 7 | Hero animations, slow ambient motion |

### Timing Functions
- **Primary**: `ease` at 142 occurrences -- the system default
- **Expressive**: `cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1)` at 21 occurrences -- used for button transitions, an overshoot-dampened curve
- **Smooth**: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` at 4 occurrences -- Material-style standard easing
- **Sharp**: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` at 4 occurrences -- fast entry, slow settle
- **Linear**: 8 occurrences -- constant-speed for progress indicators
- **Custom variables**: `--navigation-easing` (10), `--stats-section-transition-timing-function` (11), `--card-ease` (6) -- component-specific named curves

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use `sohne-var` with `"ss01"` on every text element -- the stylistic set IS the brand's typographic DNA
- Use weight 300 for all headlines and body text -- lightness is the signature that distinguishes Stripe from every heavy-handed fintech
- Apply blue-tinted shadows (`rgba(50,50,93,0.12)`) for elevated elements -- chromatic depth over flat neutral gray
- Use `#061b31` (deep navy) for headings instead of `#000000` -- the warmth matters and prevents the harshness of pure black
- Keep border-radius at 4px for interactive elements and 6px for containers -- conservative rounding is intentional
- Use `"tnum"` for any tabular or financial number display -- `"ss01"` and `"tnum"` serve distinct purposes and never coexist on the same element
- Use the `cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1)` curve for button transitions at 300ms -- this is the branded interactive feel
- Maintain the six-step text-color ladder: `#061b31` > `#273951` > `#3c4f69` > `#50617a` > `#64748d` > `#7d8ba4` -- each step has a specific role

### Don't
- Don't use weight 600-700 for `sohne-var` headlines -- weight 300 is the brand voice; 600 is reserved exclusively for CTA text and nav buttons
- Don't use large border-radius (12px+, pill shapes) on cards or buttons -- Stripe's maximum observed radius is 8px for featured elements, 16px appears only once
- Don't use neutral gray shadows -- always tint with blue (`rgba(50,50,93,...)`) for the primary elevation layer
- Don't skip `"ss01"` on any `sohne-var` text -- the alternate glyphs define the personality; removing them produces a visibly different font
- Don't use pure black (`#000000`) for headings -- always `#061b31` deep navy; the `#000000` in the token data is primarily a border/structural color (3869 border uses vs. 1592 text)
- Don't use warm accent colors (orange `#ff6118`, magenta `#f44bcc`) for interactive elements -- these are decorative and gradient-only; purple `#533afd` is the sole interactive color
- Don't apply positive letter-spacing at display sizes -- Stripe tracks tight: -1.4px at 56px, -0.96px at 48px, -0.88px at 44px
- Don't mix `"ss01"` and `"tnum"` on the same element -- `"ss01"` is for display and body, `"tnum"` is for financial data; each serves a separate mode
- Don't use `#b9b9f9` for backgrounds or text -- it is a border-only token (40 occurrences, all as `borderColor`)

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile | <640px | Single column, reduced heading sizes, stacked cards |
| Tablet | 640-1024px | 2-column grids, moderate padding |
| Desktop | 1024-1266px | Full layout, 3-4 column feature grids |
| Large Desktop | >1266px | Centered content at max-width 1266px with generous margins |

### Touch Targets
- Primary buttons use generous padding (11.5px-14.5px vertical, 20px-24px horizontal)
- Navigation buttons have 12px vertical padding for comfortable tap targets
- Navigation container uses 10px 16px padding with 6px radius
- Ghost links rely on text size (14px-16px) and spacing for adequate touch area

### Collapsing Strategy
- Hero headline: 56px display -> 44px -> 32px across breakpoints, weight 300 maintained throughout
- Navigation: horizontal links + CTAs with 6px radius container -> hamburger toggle
- Feature cards: 4-column -> 3-column -> 2-column -> single column stacked
- Stats section: horizontal stat counters at 48px -> stacked at reduced sizes
- Financial data: tight tabular layouts with `"tnum"` at 11px-14px maintain density, may horizontally scroll
- Section spacing: 96px -> 64px -> 48px as viewport narrows
- Typography scale compresses while preserving the weight 300 signature at all sizes

### Image Behavior
- Dashboard/product screenshots maintain blue-tinted shadow treatment at all sizes
- Checkout UI previews at 8px-10px text sizes maintain `"ss01"` feature settings
- Card images maintain consistent 4px-6px border-radius
- Gradient decorative elements (purple-to-magenta) simplify on mobile

### Iteration Guide
1. Always enable `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` on `sohne-var` text -- this is the brand's typographic DNA; removing it changes the visual identity
2. Weight 300 is the default for body and headings; use 400 for navigation base and UI labels; use 600 only for buttons, CTAs, and nav items
3. Shadow formula: `rgba(50,50,93,0.12) 0px 16px 32px 0px` for prominent elevation; `rgba(23,23,23,0.08) 0px 15px 35px 0px` for ambient lift
4. Heading color is `#061b31` (deep navy), body is `#64748d` (slate), labels are `#273951` (dark slate), secondary body is `#50617a` (slate blue)
5. Border-radius stays in the 4px-8px range -- 4px for buttons and inputs, 5px-6px for cards, 8px maximum for featured elements
6. Use `"tnum"` instead of `"ss01"` for any numbers in tables, charts, pricing, or financial displays -- these are mutually exclusive features
7. Button transitions use `cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1)` at 300ms -- this curve has a slight overshoot-dampened feel
8. Max content width is 1266px -- wider than many systems, reflecting Stripe's information-dense layout philosophy
