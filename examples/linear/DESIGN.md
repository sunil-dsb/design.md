# Design System: Linear

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Linear's website is a masterclass in dark-mode-first product design -- a near-black canvas (`#08090a`) where content emerges from darkness like starlight. The overall impression is one of extreme precision engineering: every element exists in a carefully calibrated hierarchy of luminance, from barely-visible borders (`rgba(255,255,255,0.05)`) to soft, luminous text (`#f7f8f8`). This is not a dark theme applied to a light design -- it is darkness as the native medium, where information density is managed through subtle gradations of white opacity rather than color variation.

The typography system is built entirely on `Inter Variable` with OpenType features `"cv01"` and `"ss03"` enabled globally, giving the typeface a geometric, single-story 'a' and adjusted letterforms that transform Inter into something distinctly Linear. The system uses three weights with strict roles: 400 for reading, 510 for emphasis and navigation, 590 for strong headings. The 510 weight is the signature -- it sits between regular and medium, creating a subtle emphasis that avoids the heaviness of traditional medium or semibold. At display sizes (72px, 64px, 48px), Inter uses aggressive negative letter-spacing (-1.584px to -1.056px), producing compressed, authoritative headlines that feel engineered rather than designed.

The color system is almost entirely achromatic -- near-black backgrounds with white-gray text -- punctuated by a single brand accent: Linear's indigo-violet (`#5e6ad2`). This accent color is used sparingly and intentionally, appearing only on CTAs, active states, and brand elements. The border system uses ultra-thin, semi-transparent white borders (`rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`) that create structure without visual noise.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Dark-mode-native: `#08090a` marketing background, `#0f1011` panel background, `#202122` elevated surfaces
- Inter Variable with `"cv01", "ss03"` globally -- geometric alternates that transform Inter into Linear's proprietary typeface
- Signature weight 510 (between regular and medium) for emphasis and UI -- the workhorse weight
- Aggressive negative letter-spacing at display sizes: -1.584px at 72px, -1.408px at 64px, -1.056px at 48px
- Brand indigo-violet `#5e6ad2` -- the only chromatic color in the entire system
- Semi-transparent white borders throughout: `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`
- Button backgrounds at near-zero opacity: `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` with `rgba(0,0,0,0.03) 0px 1.2px 0px` micro-shadow
- Multi-layered shadow stacks with inset variants for depth on dark surfaces
- Radix UI primitives as the component foundation
- `Berkeley Mono` as the monospace companion for code and technical labels

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Background Surfaces
- **Marketing Black** (`#08090a`): The deepest background -- the canvas for hero sections and marketing pages. Near-pure black with an imperceptible blue-cool undertone.
- **Panel Dark** (`#0f1011`): Sidebar and panel backgrounds. One step up from the marketing black, used exclusively for `bgColor` (18 occurrences).
- **Surface Dark** (`#161718`): Recessed panel backgrounds. A subtle lift from panel dark for nested containers.
- **Elevated Surface** (`#202122`): Card backgrounds, dropdowns, and elevated regions. The lightest structural dark with gradient and border usage across all pages.
- **Secondary Surface** (`#28282c`): Hover states and slightly elevated components. Appears on all three crawled pages as a background color.
- **Border Dark** (`#323334`): Solid dark border color and icon tint. Used where semi-transparent borders would be too subtle.
- **Mid Surface** (`#383b3f`): The lightest dark structural color -- used for borders (36 occurrences) and occasional icon fills.

### Text & Content
- **Primary Text** (`#f7f8f8`): Near-white with a barely-warm cast. The dominant text color across 8,265 text instances -- not pure white, preventing eye strain on dark backgrounds. Also mapped to `--normal-bg`.
- **Light Text** (`#e2e4e7`): Slightly subdued white for secondary headings and emphasized body text. 488 text occurrences.
- **Silver Body** (`#d0d6e0`): Cool silver-gray for descriptions and secondary content. 784 text instances with a blue undertone that keeps it cool against the warm primary text.
- **Mid Gray** (`#9c9da1`): Neutral mid-tone for icons and subtle background fills. Appears across all pages.
- **Tertiary Text** (`#8a8f98`): Muted cool-gray for placeholders, metadata, and de-emphasized content. 726 text occurrences.
- **Quaternary Text** (`#62666d`): The most subdued text -- timestamps, disabled states, subtle labels. 1,435 text instances, also heavily used as a border color (2,612).

### Brand & Accent
- **Brand Indigo** (`#5e6ad2`): Primary brand color -- CTA button backgrounds, brand marks, and interactive surfaces. The only saturated hue in the system. Used as background (6), shadow (2), and icon (2).
- **Indigo Periwinkle** (`#6d78d5`): Slightly lighter indigo variant for text accents (4 occurrences) and secondary brand elements.
- **Indigo Bright** (`#6366f1`): Higher-saturation indigo variant used exclusively for backgrounds (10 occurrences). Tailwind's `indigo-500`.
- **Violet** (`#8b5cf6`): Purple variant for accent backgrounds. Used exclusively as background color (6 occurrences).
- **Periwinkle Light** (`#8fa4ff`): Desaturated blue-violet for text highlights and border accents. 108 total frequency.

### Workflow Colors
- **Soft Green** (`#89d196`): Muted sage green for completion and progress states. Used as text (32) and border (64).
- **Active Green** (`#27a644`): Saturated green for active/in-progress status indicators.
- **Forest Green** (`#008d2c`): Deep green for confirmed success states.
- **Emerald** (`#10b981`): Secondary success -- pill badges, completion dots. Tailwind's `emerald-500`.
- **Sky Blue** (`#55cdff`): Bright cyan-blue for informational highlights. 88 text occurrences.
- **Warm Amber** (`#ffc47c`): Soft gold for warning states and attention indicators.
- **Hot Pink** (`#f79ce0`): Bright pink for labels and category differentiation. 164 text occurrences.
- **Alert Red** (`#d6303d`): Error and destructive action indicator.
- **Coral Red** (`#eb5757`): Secondary error -- used for both text (4) and background (6).

### Overlay
- **Shadow Base** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.2)`): Primary shadow opacity for elevated elements and ring shadows.
- **Deep Shadow** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`): Modal backdrops and floating element shadows.
- **Brand Shadow** (`rgba(8,9,10,0.6)`): Branded dark shadow using the marketing black hue at 60% opacity.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Primary**: `Inter Variable`, with fallbacks: `SF Pro Display, -apple-system, system-ui, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Open Sans, Helvetica Neue`
- **Monospace**: `Berkeley Mono`, with fallbacks: `ui-monospace, SF Mono, Menlo`
- **OpenType Features**: `"cv01", "ss03"` enabled globally -- cv01 provides a single-story 'a', ss03 adjusts letterforms for a geometric appearance.

### Principles
- **510 is the signature weight**: Linear uses Inter Variable's 510 weight (between regular 400 and medium 500) as its default emphasis weight. This creates a subtly bolded feel without the heaviness of traditional medium or semibold -- it appears in 12 of 25 typography levels.
- **Compression at scale**: Display sizes use progressively tighter letter-spacing: -1.584px at 72px, -1.408px at 64px, -1.056px at 48px, -0.704px at 32px. Below 24px, spacing relaxes toward normal.
- **OpenType as identity**: `"cv01", "ss03"` are not decorative -- they transform Inter into Linear's distinctive typeface, giving it a geometric, purposeful character across every text element.
- **Three-tier weight system**: 400 (reading), 510 (emphasis/UI), 590 (strong emphasis). The 300 weight appears only in deliberately de-emphasized contexts like chat message previews.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4px (detected from frequency analysis)
- Primary scale: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 28px, 32px, 36px, 40px, 48px, 56px, 60px, 64px, 80px, 96px, 128px
- Highest frequency values: 32px (825 occurrences), 8px (617), 14px (412), 12px (215), 24px (175)
- The 8px and 32px values dominate -- the system uses an 8px grid with 32px as the primary structural spacing unit

### Grid & Container
- Max content width: 100% with internal constraints
- Hero: centered single-column with generous vertical padding
- Feature sections: 2-3 column grids for feature cards
- Full-width dark sections with internal max-width constraints

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Darkness as space**: On Linear's dark canvas, empty space is not white -- it is absence. The near-black background (`#08090a`) IS the whitespace, and content emerges from it through luminance steps.
- **Compressed headlines, expanded surroundings**: Display text at 72px with -1.584px tracking is dense and compressed, but sits within vast dark padding. Section spacing reaches 128px+ at the largest breakpoints.
- **Section isolation**: Each feature section is separated by generous vertical padding (80px-128px) with no visible dividers -- the dark background provides natural separation.

### Border Radius Scale
- Micro (2px): Inline badges, toolbar buttons, subtle tags
- Standard (4px): Navigation links, code snippets, small containers
- Comfortable (5-6px): Buttons, inputs, functional elements
- Card (8px): Cards, dropdowns, popovers
- Panel (12px): Panels, featured cards, section containers
- Large (22px): Large panel elements
- Full Pill (9999px): Chips, filter pills, status tags
- Circle (50%): Icon buttons, avatars, status dots

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow, `#08090a` bg | Page background, deepest canvas |
| Subtle (Level 1) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.03) 0px 1.2px 0px 0px` | Toolbar buttons, micro-elevation (62 occurrences) |
| Ring (Level 2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` | Border-as-shadow technique for cards and inputs |
| Inset (Level 2b) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 12px 0px inset` | Recessed panels, inner shadows (12 occurrences) |
| Elevated (Level 3) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 0px 2px 4px 0px` | Floating elements, dropdowns (32 occurrences) |
| Deep (Level 4) | `rgba(8,9,10,0.6) 0px 4px 32px 0px` | Deep elevation, prominent floating panels |
| Dialog (Level 5) | `rgba(0,0,0,0) 0px 8px 2px, rgba(0,0,0,0.01) 0px 5px 2px, rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 3px 2px, rgba(0,0,0,0.07) 0px 1px 1px, rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0px 0px 1px` | Multi-layer stack for popovers, command palette |

**Shadow Philosophy**: On dark surfaces, traditional shadows (dark on dark) are nearly invisible. Linear solves this through two complementary strategies: semi-transparent white borders as the primary depth indicator, and background luminance stepping where each elevation level slightly increases the white opacity of the surface (`rgba(255,255,255,0.05)`). The inset shadow technique (`rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 12px 0px inset`) creates a unique "sunken" effect for embedded content areas. The primary CTA buttons use a four-layer shadow stack combining inset white highlights (`rgba(255,255,255,0.03)` and `rgba(255,255,255,0.04)`) with outer dark rings (`rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`) to create a three-dimensional bevel on flat dark surfaces.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use `Inter Variable` with `font-feature-settings: "cv01", "ss03"` on ALL text -- these features are fundamental to Linear's typeface identity and appear on every detected typography level
- Use weight 510 as your default emphasis weight -- it is Linear's signature between-weight, appearing in navigation, labels, badges, and headings
- Apply aggressive negative letter-spacing at display sizes: -1.584px at 72px, -1.408px at 64px, -1.056px at 48px, -0.704px at 32px
- Build on near-black backgrounds: `#08090a` for marketing, `#0f1011` for panels, `#202122` for elevated surfaces
- Use semi-transparent white borders (`rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`) instead of solid dark borders -- they create structure that breathes
- Keep button backgrounds nearly transparent: `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` with `rgba(0,0,0,0.03) 0px 1.2px 0px` micro-shadow
- Reserve brand indigo (`#5e6ad2`) for primary CTAs and brand marks only -- it is the sole chromatic color in the system
- Use `#f7f8f8` for primary text -- not pure `#ffffff`, which would be too harsh on the near-black canvas
- Apply the luminance stacking model for elevation: deeper = darker bg, elevated = slightly lighter bg via white opacity
- Use `Berkeley Mono` for any code or technical content -- it appears in code blocks, issue IDs, and terminal output

### Don't
- Don't use pure white (`#ffffff`) as primary text -- `#f7f8f8` prevents eye strain and has 25,002 frequency vs occasional `#ffffff` usage
- Don't use solid colored backgrounds for buttons -- transparency is the system (`rgba(255,255,255,0.05)`), never a flat hex
- Don't apply the brand indigo (`#5e6ad2`) decoratively -- it is reserved for interactive/CTA elements only, with just 10 total frequency
- Don't use positive letter-spacing on display text -- Inter at sizes above 24px always runs negative (-0.288px to -1.584px)
- Don't use visible opaque borders on dark backgrounds -- borders should be semi-transparent white or shadow-based ring borders (`rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px`)
- Don't skip the OpenType features `"cv01", "ss03"` -- without them, it is generic Inter, not Linear's Inter
- Don't use weight 700 (bold) -- Linear's maximum weight is 590, with 510 as the workhorse
- Don't introduce warm colors into the UI chrome -- the palette is cool gray (`#62666d`, `#8a8f98`, `#d0d6e0`) with blue-violet accent only
- Don't use drop shadows for primary elevation on dark surfaces -- use background luminance stepping and inset shadows instead
- Don't use positive radius values above 22px except for full-pill (9999px) and circle (50%) patterns

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile Small | <600px | Single column, compact padding, display text scales down |
| Mobile | 600-640px | Standard mobile layout |
| Tablet | 640-768px | Two-column grids begin |
| Desktop Small | 768-1024px | Full card grids, expanded padding |
| Desktop | 1024-1280px | Standard desktop, full navigation |
| Large Desktop | >1280px | Full layout, generous margins, section spacing up to 128px |

### Touch Targets
- Ghost buttons use minimum 4px horizontal padding with 4px radius
- Secondary buttons have `rgba(0,0,0,0.03) 0px 1.2px 0px` shadow for tactile affordance
- Navigation links at 13px with adequate spacing for mobile tap targets
- Pill elements use 9999px radius for easy thumb targeting
- Icon buttons at 50% radius ensure circular, easy-to-tap targets

### Collapsing Strategy
- Hero: 72px display -> 48px -> 32px text, letter-spacing adjusts proportionally (-1.584px -> -1.056px -> -0.704px)
- Navigation: horizontal links + CTA -> hamburger menu at 768px
- Feature cards: 3-column -> 2-column -> single column stacked
- Product screenshots: maintain aspect ratio and inset shadow treatment
- Section spacing: 128px+ -> 80px -> 48px on mobile
- Footer: multi-column -> stacked single column

### Image Behavior
- Product screenshots maintain `rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 12px 0px inset` shadow at all sizes
- Top-rounded images use `12px 12px 0px 0px` radius consistently
- Dark background ensures screenshots blend naturally at any viewport
- Floating UI element complexity may reduce on mobile for performance

### Iteration Guide
1. Always set `font-feature-settings: "cv01", "ss03"` on all `Inter Variable` text -- this is non-negotiable for Linear's look
2. Letter-spacing scales with font size: -1.584px at 72px, -1.408px at 64px, -1.056px at 48px, -0.704px at 32px, -0.288px at 24px, -0.165px at 15px, normal below 14px
3. Three weights, strict roles: 400 (read), 510 (emphasize/navigate), 590 (announce). Never use 700.
4. Surface elevation via background opacity: `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` on dark backgrounds -- never solid background colors
5. Brand indigo (`#5e6ad2`) is the only chromatic color -- everything else is grayscale with cool blue undertone
6. Borders use two techniques: semi-transparent white (`rgba(255,255,255,0.05)`) or inset ring shadows (`rgb(35,37,42) 0px 0px 0px 1px inset`) -- never solid `border-color` on dark surfaces
7. `Berkeley Mono` for any code or technical content, `Inter Variable` for everything else
8. Button transitions use `background 0.16s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)` for ghost variants and `background 0.1s` for primary CTAs
